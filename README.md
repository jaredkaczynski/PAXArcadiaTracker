# PAX Arcadia Tracker

This was made with the assumption PAX Arcadia would have a leaderboard. It did not but it was still a good project for some Ruby on Rails experience. It pulls data from a webpage via HTML parsing, checks for new data and adds any changes to a database. On a webpage request data is pulled and formatted into charts.
